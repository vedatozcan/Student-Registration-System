    used is to simply create a web server on your computer, handle the Apache, PHP and MySQL 
    installations at once and manage them through a single program.

    object-oriented PHP web application framework, providing a ready-to-use library to use with your 
    own PHP applications. For example, there is a Database API to make it easier and more 
    convenient to execute SQL queries, such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, etc., without 
    having to create a lot of repetitive code yourself. This is how an application framework is useful in 
    application development.
